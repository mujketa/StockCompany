The inventory management system is a system whose basic task is to speed up the organization's operations.
Organizations whose business is based on raw materials make enormous efforts to use materials as efficiently as possible in accordance with their needs and requirements. On such occasions, the organization
she has to perform a series of tasks and operations in order to successfully run her business without automating the system (manually).

That's why our task is to create a web application that will automate the management of some stocks
organisations. Such an application can be used in any industry sector, although the system
it can also be used in other sectors (banking, healthcare, etc.), but this project should primarily be intended for small and/or large industry.

The backend of the web application is built in Node/Express web technologies. All details are stored in mysql database.
The frontend of the web application is built in React.
The system enables easy management and maintenance of stocks. Inventory management should be developed to allow users to add inventory, modify and delete inventory, enter inventory quantities and other details, update inventory status, and more.
